## Introduction
This project aims to establish a basic model based on both linear Partial Differential Equation(PDE) and non-linear PDE to describe traffic flow.

The traffic data are collected from The Georgia Department of Transportation.

## Environment 
Please download the libraries before running the tutorial.

note: If you could not run successfully for due to the basemap issue, you could run the back up tutorial named "Traffic_Flow_Simulation_using_Atlanta_Real_Traffic_Data_V2_noBasemap.ipynb", where we delete the map visualization part.
